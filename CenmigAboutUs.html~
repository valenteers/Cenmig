                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;With the rapid advancement of sequencing technology, <b>whole genome sequencing (WGS)</b> is now becoming a standard laboratory technique in microbiology. The cost of WGS is now less than 50 USD per
                    genome, cheaper than multi-locus sequencing while giving much more information. It is thus expected that WGS will soon find its ways to a wider arena of applied microbiological research and eventually medical services.
                    Its current potentials include identification of drug resistance genes, identification of disease outbreaks, pathogen surveillance, and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<b>Pornchai Matangkasombut Center for Microbial Genomics – CENMIG</b> – was established in 2020, and is currently managed by the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. The
                    center was founded by a group of ambitious researchers with various expertise, including microbiologists, immunologists, evolutionary biologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, bioinformaticians, and statisticians, aiming
                    to study important pathogens and infectious diseases that are particularly prevalent among ASEAN populations. The main goal is to accelerate the use of WGS technology in diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of infectious
                    diseases, as well as bettering public health disease control policy through better understanding of pathogenesis, evolution, and epidemiology of pathogens. The core activities of the center are to analyse WGS data, and
                    interpret the results, as well as to provide bioinformatician capacity building for Thailand and ASEAN. The main topics of research include the study of pathogen genomes, pathogen discovery and identification through the
                    use of metagenomic approaches, and phylogenetic analysis of pathogens.

                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Emeritus Professor Pornchai Matangkasombut holds Bachelor of Arts, Doctor of Medicine and PhD in Microbiology (M.D.-Ph.D.) degrees from the University of Wisconsin and had served as an instructor at
                        the Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University since 1968. He was the first Thai national to serve as the Head of the Department of Microbiology in 1973 and had held the position for 14 years.
                        Subsequently he served as the Dean of the Faculty of Science for 2 consecutive terms (1991-1999) and became the only Dean of the Faculty of Science who was appointed as the President of Mahidol University
                        (1999-2007). He has also held numerous advisory and governing positions in several universities and academic organizations involving in research and higher education.

                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Emeritus Professor Pornchai Matangkasombut was one of the pioneers who laid a solid foundation for the graduate studies and research in microbiology in the Faculty of Science, Mahidol University and
                        has influenced research and education through his numerous students, who has become professor and researchers all over the country. He chaired an international meeting in microbiology in Thailand in 1977, served as
                        an advisor in immunology, biology, infectious diseases and vaccine development for the World Health Organization and as Secretary of Microbiology of the UNESCO Southeast Asia region as well as a number of other
                        important academic positions. He played an important role in founding Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Science (TCELS), to which he still provides advice to the present.
