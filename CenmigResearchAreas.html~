                <h2><b>Genomics</b></h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Genome is a complete set of genetic elements of an organism, including both protein and non-protein coding regions. While the latter do not code for proteins, they however do have crucial roles in
                    controlling gene expression level and 3D organization of the genome. Genomics is the study that aims at collective characterisation and quantification of all genetic elements within a genome, as well as their
                    interrelations and modifications.
                </p>
                <h2><b>Metagenomics</b></h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Metagenomics is the study of all genomes present in a sample. The term metagenome was coined by Jo Handelsman and her team from University of Wisconsin-Madison and Cornell University. Early metagenomic
                    studies relied on DNA cloning, transformant selection, Sanger sequencing and primer walking, which were highly labour-intensive and time-consuming. Such problems have been partially resolved with the advent of shotgun
                    sequencing technologies, which are capable of sequencing all nucleic acids in a sample indiscriminately, and are greatly high-throughput in nature. As a result, metagenomic next-generation sequencing is becoming more and
                    more accessible to researchers and is now being applied to various fields of biology, from medical research to environmental study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the key advantages of metagenomic next-generation sequencing is the ability to unlock the study of unculturable microbes, and, indeed, metagenomics is currently proposed as a diagnostic tool in
                    clinical microbiology. In addition to pathogen identification and discovery, metagenomic studies can shed some light on the function and dynamic of microbiota over time and space as well.
                </p>
                <h2><b>Molecular phylogenetics</b></h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary history and relationships among a group of organisms, which can be inferred from molecular data such as DNA or protein sequences. A common tool used to
                    illustrate a history or relatedness of a set of organisms is a phylogeny, also known as a phylogenetic tree. Besides reconstructing the past history of organisms, molecular phylogenetics can also be used to address
                    various other biological questions, such as estimating the temporal origin of a species, migration history of organisms, transmission history of pathogens, evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of pathogens, and many
                    more.
